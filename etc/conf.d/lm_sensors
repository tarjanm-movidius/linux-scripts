# This file is sourced by /etc/init.d/lm_sensors and defines the modules to
# be loaded/unloaded.
#
# The format of this file is a shell script that simply defines variables:
# HWMON_MODULES for hardware monitoring driver modules, and optionally
# BUS_MODULES for any required bus driver module (for example for I2C or SPI).

# Load modules at startup
LOADMODULES=no

# Initialize sensors at startup
INITSENSORS=yes

HWMON_MODULES="coretemp"
